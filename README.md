Install
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Move BTCZHalving.py in the wallet folder where bitcoinz-wallet.exe is located
3. If you want, also move RunBTCZNode.bat to easily run the full node from the command line
4. Start a graphical interface wallet or a full command line node. The script needs this to know the current block for calculating the halving start date
5. Run the BTCZHalving.py script itself

If it doesn't work, check it
1. Make sure you have install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Make sure you have launched a GUI wallet or a full node that operates in command-line interface.
3. The time format in the windows settings should be English (United Kingdom) or similar to it
